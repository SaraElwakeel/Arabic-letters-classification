# Neural Network Assignment

## Overview

This project involves building and training a **Neural Network (NN)** for a classification or regression task. The workflow includes importing a dataset, preprocessing images, constructing a neural network, training the model, and evaluating performance.

## Features

- **Dataset Importing**: Loads dataset for training.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applies transformations to enhance data quality.
- **Neural Network Model**: Implements a deep learning model.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Trains the model and assesses performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Uses accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Import the Dataset**: Load images or structured data.
2. **Preprocess Images**: Normalize and augment images if necessary.
3. **Build the Neural Network**: Define model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Train the Model**: Fit the model using training data.
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Generate accuracy and loss metrics.
